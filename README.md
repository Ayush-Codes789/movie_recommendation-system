# movie_recommendation-system

A machine learning–based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on similarity and/or user preferences.

The entire implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easy understanding and experimentation.

Recommender systems help users discover content they are likely to enjoy.

This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommender using data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity-based techniques.
